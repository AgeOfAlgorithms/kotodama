Koetama (声魂, "voice spirit" in Japanese) runs next to your game. It plays the other players' voices placed where they
stand: louder when close, muffled behind walls. It also writes what you say as you say it, so the
game can show your words in text to other players. By extension, your game or mod gains speech recognition capability, which easily lets you build speech-activated events in the game.

**What kind of communications are possible with Koetama?**

**Speech to text runs on your own PC**, and no account is needed. Your voice reaches the other players through a
small relay server, end-to-end encrypted with a key only the players in your game session have: the relay passes on
bytes it cannot listen to, and only to the players close enough to hear you.

> **Status:** early prototype, version 0.5.3. See [What's new](#whats-new).

## Highlights

- **Real voice chat.** Hear the other players where they stand: the game sets each voice's volume, direction and
  muffling. Only the players in range get your voice.
- **For deaf and hard-of-hearing players.** Everyone who talks with Koetama is captioned live, so players who can't
  hear can follow every conversation, and players without a microphone can still talk with them.
- **Many languages.** 14 fully supported, 8 in beta, 7 experimental. Speak several and mix them in one line. Pick the
  language you read once in Koetama, and chat in other languages is translated on your own PC as it arrives, in every
  game.
- **Light on your PC.** Only the speech models for your languages load: about 0.9 GB of memory for one language, up
  to 1.5 GB for several. It runs on the CPU, below the game's priority, and stays idle while you are silent.
- **Any game with a mod.** Games connect through small profile files, not plugins: anyone can add one.

## Install

**Windows:** download [`Koetama-Setup.exe`](https://github.com/AgeOfAlgorithms/koetama/releases/latest/download/Koetama-Setup.exe)
(always the newest version; every version is on [Releases](https://github.com/AgeOfAlgorithms/koetama/releases)) and run it. It installs for
your user only, with no administrator rights. Then start Koetama, pick your game mod and start the game.

**Linux / Steam Deck:** download [`Koetama-linux.tar.gz`](https://github.com/AgeOfAlgorithms/koetama/releases/latest/download/Koetama-linux.tar.gz), unpack it and run `Koetama/Koetama`. Games
running through Proton are found inside their Proton folder.

The first time you speak, Koetama downloads the speech model for your language once, showing its progress:

| Model | Languages | Download |
|---|---|---|
| Parakeet v3 | English and the other European languages | 670 MB |
| GigaAM v3 | Russian | 225 MB |
| SenseVoice | Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean | 240 MB |

**Updates:** the window's **Check for updates** installs a new version and restarts Koetama.

**Uninstalling** asks whether to remove the downloaded speech models and your settings too (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Koetama`,
with their size). The answer is Yes unless you choose No to keep them for a later reinstall.

## Game mods

| Game | Mod | Uses |
|---|---|---|
| Teardown | [Proximity Comms](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3812301496) | voices and speech to text |

**Adding a game:** a mod made for Koetama comes with a small profile file (`.json`). In the window, open the game
mod list and choose **Add game mod...**. Koetama shows what the profile reads, writes and listens on before adding
it. A profile is not a program: it only points Koetama's built-in connectors at a game's files or at a local port,
and it can ask for voices, speech to text, or both.

**Making a mod for Koetama:** see [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) for the profile format and the two connectors (files,
or a local socket), with an example profile and test client in [`examples/`](examples/).

## Languages

Open **Languages I speak → Choose...** and tick every language you speak. Fewer languages are lighter and more
accurate. With several, Koetama tells them apart as you speak, choosing only among yours. Until you choose, it
follows the game's own language setting.

| Support | Languages |
|---|---|
| **Fully supported** | English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean |
| **Beta** (less accurate) | Czech, Slovak, Romanian, Croatian, Bulgarian, Finnish, Swedish, Hungarian |
| **Experimental** (many words come out wrong) | Danish, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Slovenian, Greek, Maltese |

## How it works

| Part | How |
|---|---|
| Voices | Your voice is compressed (Opus, 24 kbit/s), encrypted (ChaCha20-Poly1305) and sent through the relay, a Cloudflare Worker ([`relay/`](relay/)), to the players in range. The game sends each speaker's volume, direction and muffle; Koetama mixes them in stereo, low-passed behind walls. |
| Speech detection | Silero VAD v5 finds where a line starts and ends. |
| Speech to text | The line so far is transcribed again every second; only words two passes agree on are shown. One more pass when you stop gives the finished line. |
| Language detection | SpeechBrain's VoxLingua107 detector splits a mixed-language line into stretches, each written by its language's model. |
| Engine | [sherpa-onnx](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx) and ONNX Runtime, on the CPU. |

## For developers

Koetama is a Rust program in [`app/`](app/), split into small crates ([`app/DESIGN.md`](app/DESIGN.md)). It needs
stable Rust, and on Windows the MSVC build tools.

```sh
cd app
cargo run -p koetama                     # the window
cargo run -p koetama -- --cli --help     # the command line, with test modes (no microphone needed)
cargo test --workspace                    # every part against the Python reference's answers
python build.py                           # dist/Koetama/ and, with Inno Setup 6, the Windows installer
```

- The language detector is built once with `python engine/export_lid.py` (torch, speechbrain and onnx).
- The first version was Python ([`engine/`](engine/)). It stays as the reference the Rust tests compare against, and
  [`bench/`](bench/) holds the benchmarks behind every model choice.
- `Koetama --selftest` checks a build's native parts. CI runs it on every build, and on Windows also installs,
  tests and uninstalls the installer.

## Privacy

Speech to text runs on your PC, and Koetama has no accounts or telemetry. Your voice goes to the other players
end-to-end encrypted through the voice relay; models and updates come from Hugging Face and GitHub. Details:
[PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## Code signing policy

Free code signing provided by [SignPath.io](https://about.signpath.io/), certificate by
[SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/).

- **What is signed:** the Windows program (`Koetama.exe`) and its installer (`Koetama-Setup.exe`), built by
  [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/build.yml) from this repository's source for each release. Nothing built
  elsewhere is signed.
- **Team:** committers and reviewers: [AgeOfAlgorithms](https://github.com/AgeOfAlgorithms); approvers (each signing
  request is approved by hand): [AgeOfAlgorithms](https://github.com/AgeOfAlgorithms).
- **Privacy:** see [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md). Koetama sends nothing to its author; it only connects to the services
  listed there, for the features you use.

## Support

Koetama is free and stays free. If it makes your games better, you can
[buy me a coffee on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/ageofalgorithms). Stars, bug reports and game mods help too.

## License

MIT, see [LICENSE](LICENSE). The models and libraries Koetama uses are listed with their licenses in
[THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt).

## What's new

### 0.5.4: Proximity Comms

- Teardown's **Proximity Babble Chat** mod is now **Proximity Comms (Text and Voice Chat)**: the game list shows the
  new name (your choice of game is kept).
- The game list: a game mod's page is a link symbol right of its row.
- The update button no longer turns a see-through colour while the update downloads.

### 0.5.3: test your microphone

- **Test microphone**, under Microphone in the window: the microphone opens for 30 s with no game needed - watch the
  level bar and see what the speech to text makes of you. **Hear yourself** plays your voice back as the other players
  will hear it (with the automatic gain and Mic boost; use headphones). Nothing is sent anywhere.
- **Per-player volume** for games: a speaker's `volume` (0..2) in the feed scales that player's voice and their
  devices ([PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md)); Proximity Babble Chat uses it for its new per-player sliders.

### 0.5.2: live words keep up

- **Live words while you talk again.** After one slow moment (a game loading, say) Koetama read the line less and
  less often, up to every 4 s, for the rest of the session: words then showed up only after you finished. It now
  follows the average, speeds back up once the PC has room, and never waits more than 2 s.

### 0.5.1: louder quiet microphones

- **Quiet microphones fixed.** Many headset and USB mics are offered to Windows as two channels with the voice in only
  one; Koetama averaged them, which halved those voices. It now uses the channel that carries the voice.
- **Automatic gain** on the voice you send, as other games' voice chat has: quiet voices are raised toward a normal
  level, shouts held back, and a soft limiter keeps peaks clean. The new **Mic boost** slider (under Microphone) adds
  up to +20 dB on top.
- **Translate your own languages too:** the Translation card's new "Don't translate" row lists the languages you speak;
  untick one to have it translated like any other.
- **Korean, Japanese or Chinese speakers** who speak only one of them: SenseVoice is told that language instead of
  guessing, so lines no longer drift into another one.
- "Join a hosted game" only shows for games whose mod needs it.

### 0.5.0: translation, set once in Koetama

- **Translate chat into: one setting in Koetama's window**, the same in every game. Lines in the languages you
  speak are left alone; anything else is translated into the language you picked. Off until you choose one.
- **No pairs to set up.** The model for a language downloads the first time someone writes in it (or turn
  downloads off and use only what is on your PC). Up to four languages stay loaded at once.
- **Better on short lines.** Accented letters and common little words now decide what language a short line is in,
  so "¿Dónde estás?" is no longer taken for English, while "ok" and "gg" stay yours.
- **For mod makers:** games no longer send translation settings. They send the chat lines they show (`to_translate`)
  and may pause translation with `"translate": false`; `translations_status` says which language the player reads
  (`into`). See [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md). Joined players in hosted games use their own setting.

### 0.4.0: translation, more games, walkie-talkies

- **Chat translation.** Lines in another language are translated on your own PC (Mozilla's offline models,
  downloaded the first time a language needs them), so you can read players you share no language with.
- **Built for more games.** One simple JSON API for every game, over a local socket, HTTP (for games whose mods can
  only make web requests) or files. Example mods for Valheim, Godot and Tabletop Simulator show how
  ([PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md)).
- **Positions instead of maths.** A game can give player positions and voice ranges; Koetama works out direction,
  loudness and who hears whom. Player ids can be Steam ids or names, and a shared `room_seed` makes the voice room.
- **Hosted games.** For games whose mods run only on the host, each player joins with a short code the game shows
  them, and their Koetama works through the host's.
- **Walkie-talkies, loudspeakers and PA systems.** A voice can also come out of devices, each with a realistic sound
  (static and squelch, a horn's ring, a hall's echo), and games choose their own effects: pitch, wobble, robot,
  echo, reverb and more.
- **For game screens.** Games are told who is talking, who is in the voice chat, and whether speech is ready.
- **Safer.** Updates must carry a signature from the release key; nobody can push a player out of a voice room by
  taking their number; join codes work once; plus the fixes from a full security audit.
- **Fixed:** on Windows, a voice connection could drop for a second at random.

### 0.3.1: Koetama

The app is now called **Koetama** (声魂, "voice spirit"). It was Kotodama ("word spirit"), a name other voice apps
already use.

- **Smoother voices.** Each voice starts playing with a small cushion, so a packet that arrives a little late no
  longer leaves a gap, and your voice is sent in smaller steps (20 ms instead of 50), so it leaves sooner.
- **Check for updates** says when it finds no releases at all, instead of "you have the latest version".

### 0.3.0: real voice chat

You can now hear the other players, not just their words. Your voice goes to the players close enough to hear you,
through a small relay server, encrypted end to end.

- **Real voices.** Koetama sends your voice (Opus, about 3 KB/s while you talk) to the players in range of your
  speaking mode, and plays theirs where they stand. Whispers reach only the players near you.
- **Push to talk.** Hold the game's talk key to talk (the Teardown mod: B, rebindable), or choose always on. The
  first syllable is not cut off, and a line ends a quarter second after you let go.
- **Voice rooms.** Each game session gets its own room and key, made by Koetama from your PC's secure random
  numbers. The host can choose the region the room lives in (Auto: near the first player to join).
- **Status for the game.** Koetama tells the game which feed versions it reads, so a mod can ask an outdated
  Koetama to update, and whether the voice server can be reached.
- **Uninstalling** asks whether to remove the downloaded speech models and your settings too (yes by default).
- **Self-test** now also sends a packet through the voice relay.

### 0.2.0: the Rust app

A rewrite of the whole app in Rust: a smaller download, no Python, and a window that works on any PC.

- **Languages I speak.** Tick the languages you speak; only their speech models load (about 0.9 GB of memory for
  one language). The list shows which languages are fully supported, in beta or experimental.
- **Game mod profiles.** Games connect through profile files anyone can write (files or a local socket), added from
  the window after a safety preview. Mods can use voices, speech to text, or both.
- **A smaller language detector:** 43 MB instead of 86, with the same results.
- **The Ember look:** a dark theme, the voice-wave icon, and an installer to match.

### 0.1.0: the first version

The first app, in Python, made for Teardown's Proximity Babble Chat mod: a window with a game picker, live words
while you talk and the finished line when you stop, word times so a player who walks up mid-sentence sees only what
they heard, test voices placed around you in the game, and a Windows installer with an updater.
